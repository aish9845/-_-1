**Iris Flower Classification**

* The project aims to classify Iris flowers into species using a Random Forest Classifier. The dataset contains attributes such as Id, SepalLength, SepalWidth, PetalLength, PetalWidth, and Species. 


* It first prepares the data, separating features (independent variables) and the target variable (Species), then splits the data into training and testing sets. A Random Forest Classifier is employed to build the classification model, which leverages an ensemble of decision trees for predictions. 


* The accuracy of the model is assessed using the test data. Additionally, a classification report provides detailed performance metrics, such as precision and recall, for each species category, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the model's effectiveness.
